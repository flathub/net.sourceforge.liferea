       <description>
-        <p>Today sees a new release of Liferea with fixes, translation updates and some major changes.</p>
-        <p><em>Integrated Download Manager</em></p>
-        <p>Starting with Liferea 1.15.9 there is a simple integrated download manager. The idea is to
-        be roughly on-par with the features modern browsers support. While the download manager
-        is basic it should improve user experience a lot.Up until now we had a hard-coded list of
-        typical download managers. This had several disadvantages. Now Liferea has a very simple
-        download manager implemented using simple single thread Python network fetching. Hopefully
-        this will increase usability and download workflows.</p>
-        <p><em>Rendering Changes</em></p>
-        <p>This release fixes the dark theme switching regression in the item view. The dark mode item view
-        feature was lost some releases ago because of GTK4 deprecations. Since GTK4 there is no more
-        GTK supported way to determine theme colors.
-
-        To still do dark mode switching Liferea follows (Devhelp and other tools using WebkitGTK) which
-        switch light/dark mode purely with CSS and static theme-independant colors.
-
-        Sadly this will mean a visible color mismatch to the GTK theme. This is mostly appearant in
-        dark mode. Also the link color is set to blueish and can't follow the GTK theme color for links anymore.
-
-        Many other applications are also suffering from this. Sorry there is just no way to do it anymore.
-        If you really hate the default CSS style please consider changing them using custom CSS.</p>
-        <p><em>Item View Layout Redesign</em></p>
-        <p>Along with the theme adaptions come a redesign of the item view. To be honest the look and feel
-        is heavily inspired by Jan Lukas Gernert's NewsFlashGTK which I consider very well done. It is a very
-        calm theme reducing distraction and a good balance for reading longer and shorter texts.</p>
-        <p><em>Reader Mode Removed</em></p>
-        <p>The user facing options to enable/disable "Reader Mode" in the preferences and the item view pane
-        content menu are now gone. The code paths were too complicated and the results and fallback in case
-        of errors was very unsatisfactory.
-
-        Still the use of "Readability.js" the library behind "Reader Mode" is still active. It is now automatically
-        applied when the HTML scraping is used. No user interaction needed.</p>
-        <p><em>Changes:</em></p>
-        <ul>
-          <li>#1391: GObject refactoring nodePtr -> Node, updateJobPtr -> UpdateJob to allow plugins modifying the feed list. (Lars Windolf)</li>
-          <li>Fixes #1387: Dark theme lost in preview window (Lars Windolf)</li>
-          <li>Fixes HTTP redirects not working (Lars Windolf)</li>
-          <li>Fixes memory leaks in network callbacks (Lars Windolf)</li>
-          <li>Fixes unnecessary LifereaBrowser clearing on layout change (Lars Windolf)</li>
-          <li>New unit tests for update handling code (Lars Windolf)</li>
-          <li>#1388 Implemented download manager plugin, all preferences for external tools were dropped (Lars Windolf)</li>
-          <li>Refactoring of plugin management, code reorganized. Disabling plugins now does not disable base plugins (needed for auth and node sources) as this would prevent startup (Lars Windolf)</li>
-          <li>Refactoring of content scraping, processing now happens in Javascript on entire source documents. We now store a bit more data, but get better extraction results (Lars Windolf)</li>
-          <li>Support for lazy loading &lt;img data-src=""&gt; definitions. This unbreaks images when scraping some websites (Lars Windolf)</li>
-          <li>Redesign of the HTML view. Look and feel is adapted from Newsflash. There is now a max-width and less cluttered reading. (Lars Windolf)</li>
-          <li>Getting rid of XSLT in favor of using Handlebars.js (Lars Windolf)</li>
-          <li>Updated Czech translation (Amereyeu)</li>
-          <li>Updated Albanian translation (Besnik Bleta)</li>

-        <p>Changes:</p>
-        <ul>
-          <li>Solve some Webkit deprecations (Lars Windolf)</li>
-          <li>Fixes #1359: Prevent passing "" as CLI argument causing a useless subscription. Also checks for duplicates when subscribing from CLI/DBUS. (Lars Windolf)</li>
-          <li>Fixes #1372: Fix feed icon not parsing if the URL doesn't have a file extension bug (Stomern)</li>
-          <li>Fixes #1382: Doesn't recognize atom:link element with no rel attribute bug (Lars Windolf, reported by Ed Davies)</li>

-      <description>
-        <p>This is a release introducing some changes. First there is a new privacy setting you can
-        enable: additionally to Do-Not-Track Liferea now supports the Do-Not-Sell user data setting.</p>
-        <p>There is a major change to the enclosure (media attachments) handling. The build in media player
-        working on a "attachment" style list view under the item content was removed. Now enclosures
-        are added via HTML audio and video tags below the item content. The idea is to play those
-        purely with WebkitGTK support. Downloading is still supported by right clicking on those tags.</p>
-        <p>Finally a long standing issue was improved: when a feed does not provide item titles Liferea now
-        uses a teaser of the item content as the title. This for example fixes the usability of Mastodon feeds.</p>
-        <p>Changes:</p>
-        <ul>
-          <li>Add Sec-GPC header support via new preference to prevent user data selling (Lars Windolf)</li>
-          <li>Drop enclosure list view in favour of embedded HTML5 audio and video elements (Lars Windolf)</li>
-          <li>Fixes #1332: Improve "*** No title! ***" for items without title (Lars Windolf)</li>
-          <li>Update appdata for 1.15.6 by (bbhtt)</li>
-          <li>appdata: Update screenshot captions and remove dead link by (bbhtt)</li>

       <description>
-        <p>This release brings small fixes and a rework of the trayicon plugin</p>
-        <p>Thanks to the work of Yuri Konotopov the trayicon plugin now supports AppIndicator
-        and libayatana. The important difference here is that the new item counter can be shown
-        as a text label next to the icon which makes for much improved rendering.</p>
-        <p>There are some limitations though as AppIndicator might not work perfect in all implementations
-        (e.g. XFCE).</p>
-        <p>Changes:</p>
-        <ul>
-          <li>Improve on #1192 by doing pane sanity checks on each resize (Lars Windolf)</li>
-          <li>Fixes #1297: Reorder loading plugins and deactivating webkit-settings (Lars Windolf)</li>
-          <li>#1305 Refactoring of the trayicon plugin to support AppIndicator and libayatana (Yuri Konotopov)</li>

-      <description>
-        <p>This will be the last unstable release before the first 1.14 release candidate. It contains
-         bugfixes and a generalization of the Google Reader API implementation we already had
-         for TheOldReader. This implementation was improved, fixing some bugs and can now
-         be used with arbitrary Google Reader services.
-        </p>
-        <p>New features: Google Reader API support
-
-           If you are a FeedHQ, FreshRSS, Basquz user or a a user of any other Google Reader
-           compatible service, you can now subscribe to those services.
-
-           Note: it currently doesn't work with Miniflux due to this miniflux/v2#1498
-           which is probably a bug in Miniflux. Once it is solved Miniflux also can be used.
-
-           If you experience any issues please open a ticket for support!
-        </p>
-        <p>GUI simplification: less cluttered item list
-
-           The item list has seen some rework. The quite large left padding (cause by reserved space
-           for expansion header) is now gone. Also the enclosures icon column was dropped. When
-           using Liferea in wide mode this really gives back a lot of vertical space, so Liferea in wide mode
-           becomes more useful half-maximized or in split screen situations.
-
-           Please give feedback how you like the change, especially the rather small padding left of the
-           favicon column (when in wide mode)!
+          Fixes a regression introduced in 1.16.3 that broken newsbins.
+          The "type" attribute in the exported OPML was wrong. If you
+          are affected please manually change "type" for your newsbins
+          back to "newsbin" in the OPML file usually
+          ~/.config/liferea/feedlist.opml.

         <p>Changes:</p>
         <ul>
-          <li>Update to Readability.js 0.41 (better image and table handling) (Lars Windolf)</li>
-          <li>Changes to UserAgent handling: same UA is now used for both feed fetching
-                and internal browsing. User agent now indicates Android+Mobile per default
-                instead of suggesting a Linux desktop to better adapt to the smaller
-                (in comparison to browsers) rendering pane. Additionally special env
-                vars LIFEREA_UA and LIFEREA_UA_ANONYMOUS now also affect the internal
-                browsing.</li>
-          <li>Improve HTML5 extraction: extract main if it exists and no article was found</li>
-          <li>#1117: Hide unused expander space in item list. This saves horizontal space. (Sefler Zhou)</li>
-          <li>Drop enclosure icon from item list. This saves horizontal space. (Lars Windolf)</li>
-          <li>#515, #962, #1113 adds generic Google Reader API support (this enables access to FeedHQ, FreshRSS, Miniflux...)</li>
-          <li>#1108, #113: Improve performance by different check order in itemset merging (suggested by mozbugbox)</li>
-          <li>Fixes #1033: Subscribing defaulted to HTML5 feeds even when real feeds do exist. (reported by Hanno Braun)</li>
-          <li>Fixes #1111: wrong base URI in reader mode (Lars Windolf)</li>
-          <li>Fixes #1112: Image duplication caused by feeds providing an image link which is also in the item description as additional metadata. (Lars Windolf)</li>
-          <li>Update of Dutch translation (Gert-dev)</li>
+          <li>Fixes #1423 regression in main window geometry restoration</li>
